# Test assignment

## Requirements

1. Create a web page using Vue.js.
2. The Page should present the following data for a YouTube Channel of your choice, using YouTube Data API:
   - Channel Name
   - Total number of views for all videos of the channel
   - Avg Views number

## Final notes

I wanted to make the page to look a bit fancier. Also it was a great opportunity for me to learn something new - Vite bundler in this case.

### What has been done

- used Vue.js, TypeScript and TailWind CSS - the stack I love
- added favicon
- added mobile layout
- added an input field for YouTube channel ID
- added two environment variables to .env file:
  - one for YouTube API key
  - one for default channel ID set to that of PewDiePie channel
- if you press Enter in an empty input default channel ID is used
- deployed to GitHub Pages [https://vb-oiko.github.io/youtube-stat-test/](https://vb-oiko.github.io/youtube-stat-test/)
